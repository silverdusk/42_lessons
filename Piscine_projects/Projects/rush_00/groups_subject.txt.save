Take the first letter of the login of your team leader, convert it to a number following this rule:
A = 1
B = 2
C = 3
D = 4
E = 5
F = 6
G = 7
H = 8
I = 9
J = 10
K = 11
L = 12
M = 13  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
N
O
P
Q
R
S
...

then your subject is the number you got modulo 5, so :
1 % 5 = 1 (your subject is 1)
2 % 5 = 2 (your subject is 2)
3 % 5 = 3 (your subject is 3)
4 % 5 = 4 (your subject is 4)
5 % 5 = 0 (your subject is 0)
6 % 5 = 1 (your subject is 1)
...
